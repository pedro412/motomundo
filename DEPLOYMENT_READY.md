## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build Fails:**
- Check Railway build logs
- Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Ensure `railway-entrypoint.sh` is executable

**Database Issues:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is added
- Check that `DATABASE_URL` is auto-set
- View migration logs in Railway console

**Static Files Not Loading:**
- WhiteNoise should handle this automatically
- Check `STATIC_ROOT` and `STATIC_URL` settings
- Verify `collectstatic` ran during deployment

**Environment Variables:**
- Double-check variable names (case-sensitive)
- Ensure `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` is set
- Verify `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=motomundo.settings_railway`

### Useful Railway Commands:
```bash
railway logs                    # View application logs
railway run python manage.py shell    # Access Django shell
railway run python manage.py migrate  # Run migrations manually
```
