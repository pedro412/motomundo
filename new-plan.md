# Community Discovery Platform Roadmap

## Project Overview

Transform the current motorcycle club management system into a **simplified community discovery platform** where clubs gain visibility, users can explore the motorcycle community, and chapter creators can join existing organizations.

**SIMPLIFIED APPROACH**: Focus on discovery features first, wiki-style editing can be added later if the product scales.

# clubs/management/commands/migrate_existing_data.py
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

class Command(BaseCommand):
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        # Set default values for existing clubs
        # Populate geographic data from existing addresses
        # Set up default ownership for existing chapters
```

### Step 3: API Testing Strategy

```python
# clubs/tests/test_discovery_api.py
class TestDiscoveryAPI(TestCase):
    def test_public_club_discovery(self):
        # Test public club listing

    def test_geographic_filtering(self):
        # Test location-based filtering

    def test_chapter_join_request(self):
        # Test requesting to join a club
```

### Step 4: Frontend Integration
